BB-8 in JavaScript.

Welcome to my Mars Rover program! This program runs using HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery. To get going, simply run the HTML file which
references the marsRover.js file and watch BB-8 move in the browser console. 

If you want to see multiple test cases go to the test-cases.txt file and copy follow the instructions to see BB-8's behavior.

Have fun!
