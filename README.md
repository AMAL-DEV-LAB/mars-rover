Welcome to my Mars Rover program! This program was built with Polymer and showcases aspects of reusable web components, data binding, HTML, and JavaScript. To get going, simply drop the "dist" folder onto a server and run the index.html. 

The "dist" folder is a vulcanized version of the code which can be found under the "app" folder. Navigate to "app/elements/mars-rover" to see the HTML, JS, and CSS files that make up the "mars-rover" element. The rest of the "app" folder contains necessary resuable componenets from Polymer as well as the structured layout from a Polymer-Starter-Kit-Plus project.

Quick view:
- app
    -- elements
        --- mars-rover
            ---- mars-rover.css
            ---- mars.rover.html
            ---- mars.rover.js
Have fun!
